## Chain of Thoughts

I'm a passionate thinker who loves to reflect on my chain of thoughts. I find great joy in reading books 📚, exploring various genres and expanding my horizons.

### 🖥️ Technology & Problem Solving

I have a great interest in technology and how it is constantly reshaping our world. But what I love even more than the tech itself is pondering on the problems this technology can solve. I believe that understanding the issues and constraints is the first step in devising an innovative solution.

### 🎨 Art & Humanities

Recently, I've found myself delving deeper into humanities, especially philosophy, art, and especially fine arts. I enjoy contemplating and questioning the deeper meanings and influences of various forms of art.

Join me on this journey of exploration and discovery!
