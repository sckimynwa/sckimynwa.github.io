How the world changes in the Fixed Supply Currency like Bitcoin? This is my personal opinion and also why i constantly changing my labor energy to Bitcoin. 

The basic idea is as follows: 

We live in an era where the value of labor is exchanged for fiat money. Most people receive a fixed salary in fiat currency, but as governments increase the money supply through credit, the value of our labor is continuously diluted. 

If our labor energy could be converted into a currency like Bitcoin, with its fixed supply, it would be resistant to dilution by credit. Consequently, people's time and labor would be more valued than in the past. In this scenario, unlike now, labor would be more valuable than capital. 

In this context, a nation's growth would be synonymous with the growth of its labor force, highlighting the importance of population growth and labor productivity. 

From an individual's perspective, this could influence the low birth rate issues in countries like South Korea. When the value of an individual's labor energy drops exponentially due to credit, envisioning a stable future becomes challenging. 

Personally, I feel that a complete transition of the global economy to a Bitcoin economy is difficult. Fiat money will likely coexist with humanity for a long time. However, the more individuals seek to convert their labor into Bitcoin, the closer we get to the points mentioned above.
