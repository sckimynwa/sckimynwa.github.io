Strive for a long-term perspective when dealing with key relationships, making investment decisions, building products, or running organizations. I believe this is one of the greatest move one can make in the game of life.

Maintaining a long-term perspective requires sustained interest in specific subjects. This offers a significant advantage, as most people lack such persistence. By committing to a long-term view, you uncover insights that others miss. 

For instance, observing companies long-term reveals intangible factors like process power and culture that aren't reflected in numbers. Similarly, with people, you begin to see the delta between yesterday and today, projecting their potential 5 or 10 years out. This sustained focus is the secret weapon in identifying opportunities others overlook.

Long-term focus isn't about snapshot metrics. It's about accumulating deltas in day-to-day perspective. This process is grueling and demands genuine care, but the payoff is immense. It's like compound interest for your understanding â€“ small, consistent observations snowball into powerful foresight.

also, Long-term accumulation of knowledge creates a powerful network effect. Imagine each observation as a node. Over time, these nodes connect non-linearly, with some becoming 'hubs' - disproportionately influential points. The path to insights is unpredictable, so consistent 'node-creation' is crucial. Once connections activate, exponential growth in understanding follows. This network effect is why sustained, long-term focus yields disproportionate returns.

So this is my logic: long-term investing over trading, small teams over large organizations, and a few close relationships over many acquaintances. This approach isn't just about external choices; it's also a framework for myself. Viewing myself through a long-term lens.
