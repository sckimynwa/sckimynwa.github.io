Studying at university is not merely about accumulating knowledge, but about 'creating frameworks' through which we perceive the world. This perspective shifts the focus from simply preparing for societal milestones like corporate employment to building a structure for academic inquiry and worldview formation.

In Heisenberg's "Der Teil und das Ganze," science is portrayed not as absolute truth, but as understanding "the extent to which I can speak about the world." Similarly, constructing frameworks for understanding humanity and the world allows us to perceive and articulate concepts previously beyond our grasp.

However, it's crucial to remember that these frameworks are also human constructs. We must be prepared to deconstruct and reassemble them, as altering our perceptual framework changes what we can articulate about the world.

As I approach graduation, I'm engaging in the process of deconstructing the frameworks I've acquired, repeatedly delving into fundamental principles and rebuilding. While this process demands significant mental energy, the advent of large language models that surpass typical human intelligence has made it more accessible.

Considering language as a framework for understanding the world, I believe it can manifest in various forms: scientific, business-oriented, or as verbal language. I'm eager to develop and introduce my own language for perceiving the world.

The emergence of these powerful AI models has not only facilitated this process but also opened up new possibilities for exploring and articulating our understanding of the world around us.
