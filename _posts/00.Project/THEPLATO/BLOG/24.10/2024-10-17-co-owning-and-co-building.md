We need to reconsider our conventional understanding of books, bookstores, and knowledge acquisition, especially from an interactive perspective. Before the internet, acquiring new information through interaction was limited. Learning was mostly one-directional unless you attended lectures or paid for private tutoring. This physical constraint shaped our definition of learning, excluding interactivity, which in turn influenced how we perceive books and bookstores.

Today, with the internet and AI surpassing average human intelligence, we have unprecedented real-time interaction capabilities. Yet, our learning methods remain stuck in the past. So, how can we redefine books and bookstores to incorporate interactivity?

Books should allow readers to reconstruct the author's thoughts from their perspective and question the author interactively. They should exist as networks of nodes and links, with paths varying based on reader interaction, rather than linear text.

Bookstores should evolve into interactive spaces for collective creation, where people read, question, and co-create. They should be places where creative thinkers exchange ideas and experiences, not just consume information passively. In these interactive bookstores, knowledge should be shared through collaborative creation and ownership, with creations freely shared for further innovation.

With advances in Speech-to-Text technology, we can now record conversations with speaker, time, and content details. This allows us to remove the time constraint in co-creation, enabling us to involve past participants in current discussions. Theoretically, we could even include historical figures like Einstein in scientific discourse.

This concept extends beyond reading to work and daily life. Consider work: it's about collaborating to generate better ideas and expanding opportunities. Isn't this domain where interactivity is crucial? Imagine a more effective work environment where co-creation is possible, and we can communicate with both contemporaries and historical figures by compressing the time axis.

As our world grows more complex, we need the wisdom to view it clearly for humanity's future. This seems achievable through collaborative creation. The future of learning and work lies in leveraging technology to break down barriers of time and space, fostering unprecedented levels of interaction and co-creation.
