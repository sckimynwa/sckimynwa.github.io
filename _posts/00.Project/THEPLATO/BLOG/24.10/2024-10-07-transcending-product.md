The lesson from physics is that it deals with what we can say about nature as a language itself. Languages inherently have this quality. People using different languages can say different things. Language determines what we can say about the world.

Scientific progress occurs when a few who try to view objects as they are, beyond the limits of current language, discover new things to say and transcend to that realm. Human civilization has advanced through such acts of transcending from here to there. Someone transcends first, shows the world that can be explained from there, and guides others.

I hope my product becomes a language that guides from here to there. A language that deconstructs existing language to view it as is, then reveals that we can speak about the world around us in this new way. If I create a product customers use daily, and through it they see new aspects of the world previously hidden, isn't my product a language?

For this, I want to deconstruct my product completely, then redefine it in relationships. Just as a chair doesn't have an essence of "sitting" but various elements temporarily unite to show the quality of "sitting," I hope my product doesn't have an essence but temporarily unites with a customer in various relationships to achieve the intended purpose.

What remains when a product is repeatedly deconstructed, and what relationships between these deconstructed elements make my product what it is? What relationships can each deconstructed element form with the customer? As opportunities for moats in small teams are disappearing, I think defining the product as a language, defining it in relationships, and intertwining it with how customers face the world could potentially become a moat.
