The goal of medieval education was to cultivate well-rounded intellectuals with comprehensive knowledge. Thus, education during this period began with "problem formulation," that is, creating propositions, and then approached these propositions through logic as the next step in problem-solving.

However, it seems quite difficult to encounter education that starts with problem formulation nowadays. While we can find the issue in the definition of education that has degenerated from self-expression to skillfully handling instruments since the Industrial Revolution, if we shift our perspective slightly to that of currency, I thought we might also find the problem in the loss of sound money.

We are living in an era with historically high time preference due to the loss of sound money. In such an era, it's very difficult to explore one's own world through hard work or to hone one's skills. This is because the value of our assets melts away to the point where it's difficult to sustain life after just a short while.

I think this loss of self-expression and creativity due to the loss of sound money is an important crossroads that humanity must overcome to move on to the next stage. These thoughts have contributed to my holding a significant portion of my assets in gold and Bitcoin, which are called sound money, for the past two years.

I want to create art, constantly question myself, and immerse myself deeply in things I find beautiful even if hundreds of millions of people don't agree. I want to give this opportunity to my children as well. What are your thoughts on sound money?
